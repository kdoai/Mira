## The Problem

Professional coaching is one of the most effective tools for personal and career growth — yet it remains inaccessible to the vast majority of people who need it most.

**The access gap is threefold:**

1. **Cost barrier.** Quality coaching costs $200–500 per hour. A typical 6-session engagement runs $1,200–3,000 — prohibitive for early-career professionals, students, and entrepreneurs.

2. **Discovery friction.** Finding the right coach requires research, trial sessions, and often word-of-mouth referrals. Most people never start because the first step feels overwhelming.

3. **Stigma and intimidation.** Many people perceive coaching as something reserved for executives or people in crisis — not a proactive tool for everyday growth.

The result: coaching remains a privilege of the already-privileged. Existing AI solutions fall short — they are either text-only chatbots with generic responses, niche tools focused on narrow skills, or cluttered with features that feel more like productivity software than a coaching relationship.

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Productivity-focused professionals aged 25–34 who already use tools like Notion and meditation/wellness apps. They value intentional self-improvement but haven't considered coaching because of cost or perceived complexity.

- Ambitious but sometimes directionless — they work hard but occasionally lack clarity on priorities
- Design-conscious — they gravitate toward minimalist, well-crafted tools
- Self-directed learners who want high-impact interactions, not hour-long commitments

**Secondary:** Entrepreneurs facing decision fatigue, career transitioners navigating pivotal choices, and anyone curious about coaching but unwilling to commit $300 to find out if it works.

## The Solution: Mira

Mira is a minimalist AI coaching app that makes high-quality coaching accessible to everyone — through expert AI coaches, real-time voice sessions, and deeply personal context.

- **5 expert coaches** with distinct personalities and methodologies (General, Career, Creativity, Wellness, Relationships), built on real coaching frameworks (GROW Model, Motivational Interviewing, ICF Core Competencies)
- **Real-time voice coaching** via Gemini Live API — bidirectional audio that feels like talking to a real coach, not dictating to a machine
- **Personal context** ("About Me") woven into every session, so coaches understand who you are, not just what you're asking
- **Custom coach creation and sharing** — build a coach for your specific needs, share it with friends via a simple code
- **Session reports** formatted like Notion pages — summary, key insights, action items, and mood observation after every conversation

Every screen is calm, warm, and intentional. The experience should feel like opening a meditation app, not a productivity tool.

## Monetization Strategy

| | Free | Pro ($9.99/mo or $79.99/yr) |
|---|---|---|
| **Text coaching** | 10 messages/day, General Coach only | Unlimited, all coaches |
| **Voice coaching** | 1 free 5-minute session | 60 minutes/month |
| **Custom coaches** | — | Create & share |

The free tier serves as a conversion funnel: one 5-minute voice session demonstrates the transformative quality of voice coaching, creating a strong emotional pull toward Pro. Estimated API cost per Pro user is ~$1.50–2.00/month (Gemini Flash Lite for text, Gemini Live for voice), yielding ~80% gross margin and an estimated LTV of ~$100 per subscriber.

The coaching industry is a $20B market growing at 6.7% annually. Mira sits in the "premium consumer" sweet spot — affordable enough to try, valuable enough to keep. The key insight: **voice coaching is the conversion engine.** The emotional bandwidth of a spoken conversation creates a qualitatively different experience that users are willing to pay for.
