## Kyohei Doai

**Strategy & IT Consultant**

Kyohei is a strategy and IT consultant with experience spanning multiple industries over the past several years. His work sits at the intersection of business strategy and technology — helping organizations identify what matters most and build the systems to execute on it.

### The Coaching Connection

Before entering consulting, Kyohei was at a crossroads. He had ambition and drive, but lacked the structured thinking to channel them effectively. A professional coaching engagement changed that trajectory. In just a few sessions, he learned frameworks for decision-making, self-reflection, and intentional goal-setting that would become the foundation of his career.

That experience didn't just help him — it fundamentally shaped how he works with others. As a consultant, Kyohei found himself naturally applying coaching principles in every engagement: asking powerful questions instead of prescribing answers, helping teams reframe problems before solving them, and creating space for people to find their own clarity.

### Why Mira

The insight behind Mira is personal: **the coaching that changed Kyohei's life cost thousands of dollars and required finding exactly the right person at exactly the right time.** Most people never get that lucky combination.

Building Mira is an attempt to close that gap — to take the frameworks, warmth, and structured thinking of professional coaching and make it accessible to anyone with a phone. Not as a watered-down chatbot, but as a genuine coaching experience that meets people where they are.

The technical architecture reflects this philosophy: real-time voice (because coaching is a conversation, not a text exchange), personal context (because good coaching requires knowing who you're talking to), and expert-designed coach personas (because methodology matters more than model size).

### Skills & Approach

- **Strategy consulting** — structured problem-solving, stakeholder alignment, prioritization frameworks
- **IT consulting** — system architecture, cloud infrastructure, data-driven decision making
- **Full-stack development** — Flutter, Python/FastAPI, Google Cloud Platform, Firebase
- **Product design** — user-centered design, rapid prototyping, minimal viable experiences
- **AI application development** — Gemini API integration, prompt engineering, real-time audio streaming

Kyohei approaches product development the same way he approaches consulting: start with the problem, understand the person, and build the simplest thing that creates real value.
